      <description>&lt;p&gt;Did you know that every story has its own taste &amp;amp; color? Some stories are between black &amp;amp; white, some are bright gold and, some are just old yellow. The &amp;lsquo;Whispering Solitude&amp;rsquo; is created to celebrate the blue stories of the imaginations running wild. One of those wild, yet colorful imaginations, is penned down by me!

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the title says, this post is here just to greet you, the visitor. You can click here, keep on reading, but all of that just to find out that there was nothing &amp;ldquo;interesting&amp;rdquo; in here. But I&amp;rsquo;ve kept a &lt;em&gt;continue reading&lt;/em&gt; link, to continue reading this post, if you want to continue reading this post. &lt;span&gt;üòÅ&lt;/span&gt;
